# PESTools with REC file reader
This is my personal version (fork) of PESTools with module set up to read and return basic optimization information/statistics from PEST Record files.
You can find the official PESTools repository here: <http://github.com/PESTools/pestools>

## General Information
PESTools is a Python package for processing and visualizing information associated with the parameter estimation software PEST and PEST++. PESTools consists of a set of Python object classes to facilitate efficient processing and visualization of PEST-related information. Processing and visualization of observation residuals, objective function contributions, parameter and observation sensitivities, parameter correlation and identifiability, and other common PEST outputs have been implemented. PESTools is integrated with the pyemu package (<https://github.com/jtwhite79/pyemu>) package for linear-based computer model uncertainty analyses, allowing for efficient computations using the Jacobian Matrix without any external utilities or files. The use of dataframe objects (pandas Python package) facilitates rapid subsetting and querying of large datasets, as well as the incorporation of ancillary information such as observation locations, times, measurement types, and other associated information. PESToolsâ€™ object methods can be easily scripted with concise code, or alternatively, the use of IPython notebooks allows for live interaction with the information.

##Installation
Currently PESTools runs in **Python 2.7**. The Anaconda Python distribution provides a free and easy way to install and maintain python and many popular python packages: (<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>).

####Package dependencies:
* **NumPy**  
* **pandas**  
* **matplotlib**
* **pyemu** (<https://github.com/jtwhite79/pyemu>)  
* **fiona** (only for shapefile methods)  
* **shapely** (only for shapefile methods)

####To install PESTools from the GitHub repository:
After cloning or downloading the repository, navigate to the root pestools folder and run **setup.py**, e.g.  

```python
$ python setup.py install
```
